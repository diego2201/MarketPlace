# DApp Etherum Marketplace - Spring 2024
This project is an Ethereum-based Marketplace Interface that enables users to interact with a smart contract to allows them to list items for sale, purchase them, and view item details directly from their browser using their MetaMask account.
<strong>Please Note</strong> That for this website you will need to wait a few seconds (and maybe even just reload the page) to see changes to the listing appear. 

## What is needed to use
All you need installed to use this website application is the Metamask extension. In order to download this (on Google Chrome) go to the following link: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn <br /> 
Once installed you just need to make an account. Once created you will need some Sepolia testnet coins to be able to actually interact with the Marketplace. You can obtain some using the following faucet site: https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/#/claim/2b9f1b9c-883e-4f68-b9f8-7239a31f4a73 <br />
Now you will be able to interact with the website! <br />
